The [DeepSqueak](/posts/deep-squeak/) post insprired me to try something similar with [Xeno Canto](https://www.xeno-canto.org/) bird recordings as their bird sonograms like [this one](https://www.xeno-canto.org/454376) look similar.

This page tries to formulate the project objectives.

## Project so far

- [Fetch db and files](/projects/DeepBird/fetch-files.html)
- [Find training data](/projects/DeepBird/find-train-test-data.html)

## Project outline

We'll try to use Microsofts [Team Data Science Process Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/) as a guideline for this project.
